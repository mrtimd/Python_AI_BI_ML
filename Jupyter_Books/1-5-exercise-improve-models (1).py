# # Exercise: Datasets in Python
# 
# In the previous exercise, we loaded some data and fit a model to it. Several aspects of this were simplified, particularly that the data was hard-coded into our python script, and we didn't spend any time really looking at the data itself.
# 
# Here, we'll load data from a file, filter it, and graph it. Doing so is a very important first step in order to build proper models, or to understand their limitations.
# 
# As before, there's no need to edit any code in the examples in this unit. Try to read it, understand it, then press the **Run** button to run it. As always, it's vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.
# 
# ## Load data with Pandas
# 
# There are large variety of libraries that help you work with data. In Python, one of the most common is _Pandas_. We used pandas briefly in the previous exercise. Pandas can open data saved as text files and store it in an organized table called a `DataFrame`.
# 
# Let's open some text data that's stored on disk. Our data is saved in a file called `doggy-boot-harness.csv`.

# In[ ]:


import pandas
get_ipython().system('wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-introduction-to-machine-learning/main/graphing.py')
get_ipython().system('wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-introduction-to-machine-learning/main/Data/doggy-boot-harness.csv')

# Read the text file containing data using pandas
dataset = pandas.read_csv('doggy-boot-harness.csv')

# Print the data
# Because there are a lot of data, use head() to only print the first few rows
dataset.head()


# As you can see, this dataset contains information about dogs, including their doggy boot size, harness size, sex, and age in years.
# 
# Data is stored as columns and rows, similar to a table you might see in Excel.
# 
# ## Filter data by Columns
# 
# Data is easy to filter by columns. We can either type this directly, like `dataset.my_column_name`, or like so: `dataset["my_column_name"]`.
# 
# We can use this to either extract data, or to delete data.
# 
# Lets take a look at the harness sizes, and delete the `sex` and `age_years` columns. 

# In[ ]:



# Look at the harness sizes
print("Harness sizes")
print(dataset.harness_size)

# Remove the sex and age-in-years columns.
del dataset["sex"]
del dataset["age_years"]

# Print the column names
print("\nAvailable columns after deleting sex and age information:")
print(dataset.columns.values)


# 
# ## Filter data by Rows
# 
# We can get data from the top of the table by using the `head()` function, or from the bottom of the table by using the `tail()` function. 
# 
# Both functions make a shallow copy of a section of our dataframe. Here, we're sending these copies to the `print()` function. The head and tail views can also be used for other purposes, such as for use in analyses or graphs.

# In[ ]:


# Print the data at the top of the table
print("TOP OF TABLE")
print(dataset.head())

# print the data at the bottom of the table
print("\nBOTTOM OF TABLE")
print(dataset.tail())


# We can also filter logically. For example, we can look at data for dogs who have a harness smaller than a size 55.
# 
# This works by calculating a `True` or `False` value for each row, then keeping only those rows where the value is `True`.

# In[ ]:


# Print how many rows of data we have
print(f"We have {len(dataset)} rows of data")

# Determine whether each avalanche dog's harness size is < 55
# This creates a True or False value for each row where True means 
# they are smaller than 55
is_small = dataset.harness_size < 55
print("\nWhether the dog's harness was smaller than size 55:")
print(is_small)

# Now apply this 'mask' to our data to keep the smaller dogs
data_from_small_dogs = dataset[is_small]
print("\nData for dogs with harness smaller than size 55:")
print(data_from_small_dogs)

# Print the number of small dogs
print(f"\nNumber of dogs with harness size less than 55: {len(data_from_small_dogs)}")


# This looks like a lot of code, but we can compress the important parts into a single line.
# 
# Let's do something similar: restrict our data to only those with boot sizes smaller than 40. 

# In[ ]:


# Make a copy of the dataset that only contains dogs with 
# a boot size below size 40
# The call to copy() is optional but can help avoid unexpected
# behaviour in more complex scenarios
data_smaller_paws = dataset[dataset.boot_size < 40].copy()


# Print information about this
print(f"We now have {len(data_smaller_paws)} rows in our dataset. The last few rows are:")
data_smaller_paws.tail()


# ## Graph Data
# 
# Graphing data is often the easiest way to understand it. 
# 
# In these exercises, we usually make our graphs using code in a custom file we've created, called `graphing.py`, which you can look at on our github page.
# 
# Here, we'll practice making a graph without this custom code, however.
# 
# Lets make a simple graph of harness size versus boot size for our avalanche dogs with smaller feet. 

# In[ ]:


# Load and prepare plotly to create our graphs
import plotly.express
import graphing # this is a custom file you can find in our code on github

# Show a graph of harness size by boot size:
plotly.express.scatter(data_smaller_paws, x="harness_size", y="boot_size")


# ## Create New Columns
# 
# The preceding graph shows the relationship we want to investigate for our store, but some customers might want harness-size lists in inches, not centimeters. How can we view these harness sizes in imperial units?
# 
# To do this, we will need to create a new column called `harness_size_imperial` and put that on the X axis instead.
# 
# Creating new columns uses very similar syntax to what we've seen before.

# In[ ]:


# Convert harness sizes from metric to imperial units 
# and save the result to a new column
data_smaller_paws['harness_size_imperial'] = data_smaller_paws.harness_size / 2.54

# Show a graph of harness size in imperial units
plotly.express.scatter(data_smaller_paws, x="harness_size_imperial", y="boot_size")


# We've now graphed our new column of data (`harness_size_imperial`) against boot size for dogs with small paws.
# 
# ## Summary
# 
# We've introduced working with data in Python, including:
# 
# * Opening data from a file into a `DataFrame` (table)
# * Inspecting the top and bottom of the dataframe
# * Adding and removing columns of data
# * Removing rows of data based on criteria
# * Graphing data to understand trends
# 
# Learning to work with dataframes can feel tedious or dry, but keep going, because these basic skills are critical to unlocking exciting machine-learning techniques that we'll cover in later modules.
